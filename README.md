# Capstone Website

A website I made for an assignment in my Fullstack Web and Software Engineer course. It is informative about guitars and guitarists. I used Bootstrap to give it a sleek look. It has a form for **comments**, functions where you can **like** articles, and **save them for later**. The save for later function also adds these links to a page where you can find all the articles you saved.
